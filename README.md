# TryHackMe

TryHackMe is a great resource to help with learning, understanding and using the tools needed in the cyber career field. I have completed several learning paths which has helped immensely with the CTF events. TryHackMe combined with CyberVets.org has been a great 1-2 punch in my transition out of the military and into my new career.
